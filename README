A filtering widget for weblocks.

Allows to use complex filters for equality, similarity for text values.
Complex means that you can add "AND", "OR" conditions to filters in any way you want.
Allows to use filters of any complexity in perspective.

  :dataseq-instance dataseq-instance
  :form-fields (list 
    (list 
     :id :name
     :caption "Name"
     :accessor #'person-first-name)
    (list
